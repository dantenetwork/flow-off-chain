# Tutorial

This is a simulator of off-chain routers and other chains interacting with resources/smart contracts on Flow.    
The [detailed tutorial guide](https://github.com/dantenetwork/cadence-contracts/tree/SQoS/test/SQoS-Test/README.md) could be found in the contract repo, and this is not repeated here.  

Simply, use  

```sh
npm install

node sqosSimulator.mjs -h
```

for help.
